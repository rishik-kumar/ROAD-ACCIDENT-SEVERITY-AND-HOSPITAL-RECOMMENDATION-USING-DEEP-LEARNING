# ROAD-ACCIDENT-SEVERITY-AND-HOSPITAL-RECOMMENDATION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
This project implements a deep learning-based system to predict the severity of road accidents and recommend the nearest suitable hospital for emergency response. Using real-world accident data, the system classifies the severity of an accident (minor, moderate, or severe) based on key features such as location, time, weather conditions, vehicle details, and more. Based on the predicted severity and accident location, it recommends hospitals equipped to handle the situation effectively, ensuring timely medical attention and reducing fatality rates.
The goal is to support emergency services and smart city initiatives by enabling faster, more accurate decision-making during road accidents.

Key Features:
Predicts accident severity using deep learning (ANN/CNN)
Recommends hospitals based on severity and proximity
Uses geospatial data and real-time inputs (if enabled)
Trained on open-source datasets with preprocessed features
Helps in reducing emergency response time

Road accidents are a major cause of fatalities and severe injuries worldwide, 
requiring immediate medical attention to minimize casualties. Traditional methods of 
accident severity assessment rely on emergency calls, telematics systems, and on-scene 
evaluations by first responders, which often result in delays and inaccurate severity 
classification. To address these challenges, this project proposes an AI-driven accident 
severity detection and hospital recommendation system using deep learning techniques. 
The system employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to analyze accident 
images and classify injuries based on their type (Head, Hand, or Leg) and severity (Minor 
or Major). If an injury is detected as major, the system automatically recommends the most 
suitable hospital based on factors such as hospital specialization, proximity, and 
availability. 
To improve classification accuracy, a dataset comprising accident images is 
collected and data augmentation techniques such as rotation, flipping, and brightness 
adjustment are applied to enhance model robustness. The dataset is then preprocessed, 
resized to a standard format, and normalized before training. Various machine learning 
models including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Decision Tree are 
also tested for performance comparison. 
The CNN model achieves the highest accuracy of 99.1%, outperforming traditional 
machine learning models. Performance evaluation is conducted using accuracy, precision, 
recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix to ensure the reliability of the system. The model is 
implemented using Python in Jupyter Notebook, and the trained model is deployed for 
real-time accident severity detection and hospital recommendation. 
This system has the potential to be integrated with smart city infrastructure, IoT
based accident detection, and emergency response services, enabling real-time accident 
analysis and reducing response times. By automating injury classification and hospital 
selection, this project aims to enhance emergency medical care, reduce fatalities, and 
improve healthcare resource allocation.
