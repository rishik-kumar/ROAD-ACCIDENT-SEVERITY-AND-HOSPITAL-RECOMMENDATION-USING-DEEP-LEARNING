# ROAD-ACCIDENT-SEVERITY-AND-HOSPITAL-RECOMMENDATION-USING-DEEP-LEARNING
This project implements a deep learning-based system to predict the severity of road accidents and recommend the nearest suitable hospital for emergency response. Using real-world accident data, the system classifies the severity of an accident (minor, moderate, or severe) based on key features such as location, time, weather conditions, vehicle details, and more. Based on the predicted severity and accident location, it recommends hospitals equipped to handle the situation effectively, ensuring timely medical attention and reducing fatality rates.
The goal is to support emergency services and smart city initiatives by enabling faster, more accurate decision-making during road accidents.

Key Features:
Predicts accident severity using deep learning (ANN/CNN)
Recommends hospitals based on severity and proximity
Uses geospatial data and real-time inputs (if enabled)
Trained on open-source datasets with preprocessed features
Helps in reducing emergency response time
